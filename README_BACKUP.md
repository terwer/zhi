## Zhi family

- zhi-framework
- zhi-theme
- zhi-widget-publisher (sy-post-publisher)
- zhi-plugin-publisher
- zhi-widget-blog
- zhi-plugin-blog

## Key benefits

- Integrated blog feature based on the Siyuan API

- No publishing, no configuration, ready to use out of the box

- Plugin system bundled, by design

## Quick start

You can download the `zhi` theme directly in the Market of siyuan-note, and then select the `zhi` theme
in `Settings` - `Appearance` - `Theme` to change the appearance of the notebook.

Note: `zhi` theme only supports siyuan-note `2.7.6+`, or you must upgrade siyuan-note first.

## Design Philosophy

-   The theme core should be kept lightweight and compact as much as possible.
-   Plugins should be used as much as possible to implement functions.
-   Plugin functions should be single-purpose to avoid brainless accumulation of functions.
-   Components should be kept as reusable as possible.

## Core Features

The theme is inspired by `Zhihu` but not limited to its style. The appearance optimization includes but is not limited
to:

-   Font style beautification, using `Open Sans` for English and `LXGW WenKai` for Chinese
-   Background color optimization, overall layout and spacing optimization
-   Code block beautification, similar to the Mac window style
-   It natively supports the plugin system and comes with many built-in plugins. The plugin system is supported by
    community developers.
    -   Siyuan-note publishing tool plugin
    -   Document image background automatic transparency plugin
    -   Blog plugin
-   It can handle both the theme and the preview. Installing the zhi theme is equivalent to installing an additional
    plugin system and an online blog.
    -   SPA blog homepage( `enabled and bundled by default` ): http://127.0.0.1:6806/appearance/themes/zhi/web/blog/ <sup>simple</sup>
    -   SSR blog homepage( `‚ö†Ô∏è need to be enabled manually` ): http://127.0.0.1:6806/appearance/themes/zhi/server/blog/ <sup>seo friendly</sup>

> Note: üåπ The plugin system is provided by enthusiastic community developers. Please understand the relevant mechanisms in
> detail before using.
